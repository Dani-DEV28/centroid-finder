# Improvements
- ## refactoring code
  - What improvements can you make to the design/architecture of your code?
    - Possibly put some code in from the router files into a exported function 
    storted in the controllers folder 
    - fix the Main java, since the code output path ignores anything from Node
  - How can you split up large methods or classes into smaller components?
  - Are there unused files/methods that can be removed?
    - None from what I know
  - Where would additional Java interfaces be appropriate?
    - If I am understanding interface for the API, currently we are using the videoProcessor, but I would like to include an interface for the ImageSummaryApp to do Realtime binarizing of image on the frontend
  - How can you make things simpler, more-usable, and easier to maintain?
    - Writting more documentation/comments
  - Other refactoring improvements?
    - Changing the Dockerfile from and two file setup to a single Dockefile

- ## adding tests
  - What portions of your code are untested / only lightly tested?
    - The api routes
  - Where would be the highest priority places to add new tests?
    - For the api routes
  - Other testing improvements?

- ## improving error handling
  - What parts of your code are brittle?
  - Where could you better be using exceptions?
    - Possibly in the server files
  - Where can you better add input validation to check invalid input?
    - In the server files
  - How can you better be resolving/logging/surfacing errors? Hint: almost any place you're using "throws Exception" or "catch(Exception e)" should likely be improved to specify the specific types of exceptions that might be thrown or caught.
  - Other error handling improvements>

- ## writing documentation
  - What portions of your code are missing Javadoc/JSdoc for the methods/classes?
    - frameExt.java
    - VideoProcessor.java
  - What documentation could be made clearer or improved?
    - frameExt.java
    - VideoProcessor.java
    - server files
  - Are there sections of dead code that are commented out?
    - Yes, in a couple files
  - Where would be the most important places to add documentation to make your code easier to read?
    - The server files
  - Other documentation improvements?
- ## improving performance (optional)
  - What parts of your code / tests / Docker image run particularly slowly?
  - What speed improvements would most make running / maintaining your code better?
  - Other performance improvements?
- ## hardening security (optional)
  - What packages / images are out of date / have security issues?
  - Where could you have better input validation in your code to prevent malicious use?
  - Other security improvements?
- ## bug fixes (optional)
  - What bugs do you know exist?
  - What parts of the code do you think might be causing them?
  - Other bug fix improvements?
- ## other
  - Any other improvements in general you could make?
